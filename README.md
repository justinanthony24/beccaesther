For what it's worth

Every word of Love you ever expressed to me was 100 percent a complete lie and fabrication. You were never on my side, never made me feel loved and are without a doubt the single most catastrophic mistake i ever made in my entire life. You are the most important life lesson I've ever had to learn.
Other than your physical well being, i could not care less about anything that happens to you going forward in your life. You are but a bad dream to me that i am finally waking up to. So thank you. Thank you for waking me up out of this two year long nightmare so that i can finally move forward with my life. I can stop wasting my time with someone who is my enemy and focus on bettering myself which will attract someone who will want nothing but to be on my team and build life and family together. Goodbye
You are to never contact me again, i dont care how long its been or what happens in your life. I am no longer your last resort.
For what it's worth, you aren't worth anything to me anymore.
And it feels like i can finally fucking breathe
And God damn does it feel good
